Bootcamp assignment

## Description

This is the second assignment for the Bootcamp. PORTFOLIO was great fun and I have used all the skills and knowledge gained in the past few weeks.

It was quite easy looking when I was making it in my imagination, but when I started building it, I came to know that it is not easy to build a web page from scratch.

I used the sample, provided in homework README and came up with my end result.
